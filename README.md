How To Make Decision Tree Algorith With Python

## Pros:
* This Algorithm Can Work With Any Dataset, It Will Generate The Best Tree It Can From This Dataser

## Cons:
* This Algorithm Work Only on Catigoral Dataset, Means Will Interact With Each Element In The Dataset as itself, no greater than, or smaller than, If we make an attribute with Numbers, will interact with each number as a separate Element
* Can't Draw Graphical Tree With a Good Way
